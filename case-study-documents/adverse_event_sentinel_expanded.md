# Adverse-Event Sentinel (AES)
## Real-Time Risk Management Dashboard

### Executive Summary

Adverse-Event Sentinel (AES) is a near-real-time dashboard that transforms how healthcare systems manage patient safety and risk. By automatically detecting and validating adverse events, AES enables risk management teams to intervene before patient discharge, significantly reducing potential harm and legal exposure.

**Key Impact:**
- Reduced detection-to-review time from 11 days to 18 hours (89% improvement)
- Increased in-house event review rate from 14% to 63%
- Achieved 93% confirmed event capture rate
- Reduced false positives by 81%

## The Challenge

### Problem Space
MetroHealth Alliance, an 18-hospital system handling 2.3M annual encounters, faced significant challenges in their risk management process:

1. **Delayed Response**: Risk teams spent days manually reviewing incident reports and claims
2. **Missed Opportunities**: Many preventable events weren't caught until after patient discharge
3. **Resource Intensive**: Manual review of hundreds of incident reports weekly
4. **System Silos**: Critical information spread across multiple disconnected systems

### Business Impact
- Increased malpractice exposure due to delayed intervention
- Higher costs from preventable adverse events
- Inefficient use of risk management resources
- Poor visibility into real-time patient safety metrics
