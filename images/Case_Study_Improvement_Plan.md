Individual Case Study Improvement Plans
1. Pascal SAFETY Copilot Case Study
Current Strengths
✅ Clear narrative flow (Challenge → Research → Design → Solution → Impact) ✅ Strong metrics (-71% review time, 28→8 min) ✅ Good use of process steps (3 numbered steps) ✅ Effective blockquotes from users
Issues to Address
❌ Generic hero gradient (same dark blue as all others) ❌ Research section lacks depth - Only 4 bullet points, generic research image ❌ Design Process Step 1 too technical - "Signal Mapping" with LLM prompts may be too technical for portfolio audience ❌ Missing actual wireframes - Only has one generic wireframe image ❌ Solution section lacks detail - Could show more of the copilot interface/interaction patterns
Specific Improvements
Content:
Add "Key Research Insight" callout box highlighting the "65% of review time spent hunting" finding
Expand research section with persona snippet or journey map findings
Reframe "Signal Mapping" as "Understanding the Workflow" or "Mapping Clinical Review Patterns"
Add interaction design details to solution (how nurses actually use the copilot)
Include metrics progression chart (baseline → pilot → full rollout)
Visual:
New hero gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #1e3a8a 0%, #10b981 50%, #06b6d4 100%) (deep blue → emerald → cyan for AI/healthcare theme)
Add annotated wireframe showing key UI decisions
Create simple process flow diagram showing before/after workflow
Add screenshot annotations highlighting key copilot features

2. FLAER Mobile AI Case Study
Current Strengths
✅ Most complete case study (4 design process steps) ✅ Strong impact metrics (-70% time, +85% completion, 157% more reports) ✅ Good use of images (has actual mobile UI screenshots) ✅ Excellent user quote about ease of use ✅ Best "Solution" section with detailed feature list
Issues to Address
❌ Same generic hero gradient ❌ Research section image is just a spreadsheet - not compelling ❌ Design Process Step 1 diagram is too generic - doesn't show actual conversation flow ❌ Missing the "why voice vs text" conclusion - Says they tested both, but doesn't state the finding ❌ LLM fine-tuning section too technical for non-technical audience
Specific Improvements
Content:
Add finding about voice vs. text preference (e.g., "78% preferred text input over voice due to privacy concerns on hospital floors")
Simplify "LLM Fine-tuning" to "AI Training & Optimization" with user-focused language
Add "Design Decision" callout boxes explaining key choices (e.g., why conversation over forms)
Include example conversation flow in Design Process Step 1
Add "Privacy by Design" feature highlight (mentioned in solution but deserves emphasis)
Visual:
New hero gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #059669 0%, #0891b2 100%) (emerald → cyan for healthcare/mobile theme)
Replace spreadsheet research image with journey map or user pain point visualization
Create conversation flow diagram showing actual FLAER interaction pattern
Add mobile UI annotation showing key interaction patterns
Include side-by-side: legacy form vs. FLAER conversation

3. Pascal RISK Case Study
Current Strengths
✅ Strong narrative (reactive → proactive transformation) ✅ Impressive metrics (91 days → 9 days median investigation time) ✅ Lloyd's Lab award prominently featured ✅ Good use of timeline visualization in Challenge section ✅ Clear stakeholder research approach (9 risk managers, 6 nurses, 2 attorneys)
Issues to Address
❌ Same generic hero gradient ❌ Research section lacks visual depth - Journey map image is small and unclear ❌ Design Process lacks UI focus - Mostly about algorithms/signals, less about UX decisions ❌ Missing actual dashboard screenshots in Design section - Dashboard shown in Solution but not in Design Process ❌ Award section formatting inconsistent with BCBSNC award section
Specific Improvements
Content:
Add "Stakeholder Alignment" callout showing how you balanced needs of risk managers, nurses, attorneys
Expand "Interface Design" step to show specific UX decisions (notification hierarchy, dashboard prioritization logic)
Add "Design Challenge" for balancing sensitivity (catch all events) vs. specificity (reduce false positives)
Include "From Algorithm to Interface" showing how detection signals became actionable UI elements
Add timeline showing pilot → rollout phases with learnings at each stage
Visual:
New hero gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #991b1b 0%, #475569 100%) (deep red → slate for risk/legal theme)
Enlarge journey map or create simplified version highlighting key pain points
Add dashboard wireframe progression (v1 → v2 → final)
Create "notification card anatomy" diagram showing UX thinking
Include severity-based color system explanation

4. Payment Integrity Compass (PIC) Case Study
Current Strengths
✅ Strong business impact ($28M recovered at Cleveland Clinic) ✅ Clear problem statement (underpayment recovery inefficiency) ✅ Good executive quote ("This application literally prints money!") ✅ Mental model methodology mentioned (Indi Young)
Issues to Address - MOST INCOMPLETE CASE STUDY
❌ MAJOR: Only 1 design process step (vs. 3-4 for others) ❌ Same generic hero gradient ❌ Mental model diagram is overly simplified - Doesn't show actual insights ❌ Missing Design Process Steps 2-4 - Goes from mental models directly to solution ❌ Solution section lacks UI details - Just lists features without showing how they work ❌ No wireframes or design progression shown ❌ Research image (pic-process-flow.png) not clearly explained
Specific Improvements - PRIORITY CASE STUDY FOR ENHANCEMENT
Content - ADD MISSING DESIGN STEPS: Step 2: Data Visualization Exploration
How you designed the "Opportunity Engine" algorithm into understandable UI
Variance Explorer initial concepts
How to show line-item comparisons clearly
Dashboard design for executives vs. specialists
Step 3: Workflow Integration
How appeal workflows were designed
Bulk processing interface design
Integration with existing revenue cycle tools
User testing findings and iterations
Step 4: Executive Dashboard Design (or combine with Step 2)
How to present $28M opportunity to C-suite
Real-time analytics visualization
ROI tracking interface
Additional Content:
Expand mental model diagram to show actual tasks/beliefs/gaps
Add "Design Principle" callouts (e.g., "Make small-dollar claims worth pursuing")
Include before/after workflow comparison
Add impact progression (alpha partner → 75 health systems)
Visual:
New hero gradient: linear-gradient(135deg, #065f46 0%, #1d4ed8 100%) (deep green → blue for revenue/finance theme)
Create comprehensive mental model visualization showing discovery process
Add dashboard wireframe/mockup showing variance explorer

Issues to Address
❌ Same generic hero gradient ❌ Usability testing image (morae-notes.png) is small/unclear ❌ Wireframe image (bcbsnc-wire.png) lacks context - needs annotation ❌ Decision support wizard image unclear - hard to see the actual interface ❌ "Solution" final image is 2025 current state - shows longevity but not your actual design ❌ Missing the connection between research findings and design decisions
