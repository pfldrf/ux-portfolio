Here’s a first-pass image inventory—page-by-page, section-by-section—so we can see every visual gap and decide what to create next. (I note where a placeholder already exists but could be improved.)

# 1. Home / Index (index.html)
Section	Recommended image(s)	Notes & Rationale
Hero header	• Updated geometric/AI-inspired 3-D shapes or animated WebGL background
• Optional stylised headshot of you (monochrome + brand accent)	Existing block of abstract divs works but feels generic; a richer hero sets brand tone 
Project cards	High-fidelity “cover” images for each case study (one landscape, ~1440×900)	Replace current quick grabs (e.g., FLAER splash) with polished comps that echo each project’s colour palette 
Process steps	Minimal line icons (discover / define / design / deliver)	Adds instant scannability to the 4-step graphic 
Expertise grid	6–8 micro-icons (AI, UX research, prototyping, etc.)	Keeps list from feeling text-heavy
Contact banner	Soft radial-gradient background or blurred hospital dash photo	Gives “Let’s work together” section more visual weight

# 2. FLAER Mobile AI Case Study (flaer-case-study.html)
Section	Recommended image(s)	Notes & Rationale
Hero	• Custom SVG background already referenced (images/flaer-hero-bg.svg)—keep but refine with subtle chat bubbles + cross symbolism
• 3-D angled iPhone mock-up w/ splash + chat screen carousel	Replaces commented-out mockup block 
The Challenge	• Existing “legacy form” mockup is great 

• Add contextual photo of nurse struggling at workstation (dimmed overlay)	Sets emotional tone
Challenge stats	Horizontal stat bar or donut trio (31 % / 68 % / 47 categories)	Animated count-up on scroll
The Solution	Short screencast GIF of conversational flow inside device frame (loop 6–8 s) 
Design process	5-step numbered timeline illustration (simple line + icon per phase)	
Key metrics	Metric cards already coded—drop in large numeric tiles with subtle icons	
Testimonial	Round portrait of UnityCare clinical champion quoted in blockquote	

# 3. Adverse-Event Sentinel (AES) Dashboard (aes-case-study.html)
Section	Image(s)	Notes
Hero	Dashboard hero shot inside ultra-wide browser mock-up + glowing grid overlay (ties to existing SVG grid)	
The Challenge	Infographic comparing “11 days” vs real-time, etc. 
Solution / Key Features	• Full-bleed screenshot of live AES dashboard
• Animated micro-demo GIFs for “drill-down”, “cross-hospital benchmarking” cards 
Learning roadmap	Road-map illustration already present → enhance with colour call-outs	

# 4. ECR Copilot Assistant (copilot-case-study.html)
Section	Image(s)	Notes
Hero	Split hero: left AI “spark” overlay, right desktop EMR + Copilot side panel 
Evidence timeline split-screen	Existing in-page demo good—crop to hero cover for list card	
Key Interface Features	Three short looping GIFs highlighting timeline filtering, AI highlight, document polish 
Metrics	2× bar charts already coded—ensure branded colour palette	

# 5. BCBSNC Insurance Shopping Platform (health-insurance-case-study.html)
Section	Image(s)	Notes
Hero	Large desktop + mobile side-by-side of “Compare Plans” UI above dark gradient hero 
Award badge	Vector ribbon already present—polish with subtle sheen 
The Challenge	Process diagram of legacy phone-support funnel + stat overlays 
Scenario cost estimator	Interactive slider GIF (family vs budget vs chronic)	
Design decisions	Before/after mini-screens for terminology tooltips, deductible sliders	

# 6. Payment Integrity Compass (PIC) (pic-case-study.html)
Section	Image(s)	Notes
Hero	Compass-inspired data-radar behind angled dashboard mock-up 
Challenge / Opportunity	Sankey diagram showing dollars recovered vs leakage	
Feature matrix	Icon grid for auto-reporting, visual builder, etc. 
Results	Stacked column chart: before/after recovery trend	

# 7. Global / Shared Assets
Usage	Image(s)	Notes
Navigation dropdown	64 × 64 emoji-style glyphs already used; consider vector upgrade for consistency	
Favicon & logo	Refined “SS” monogram for browser tab and footer	
Placeholder pattern	Subtle light-grid SVG (already referenced) as default empty-state filler
